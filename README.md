# The code provided here is sufficient to replicate the simulations presented in the above paper. 
# If you are interested in running the same or additional simulations, and need help
# feel free to get in touch with at least one (preferably both) of the following researchers:
#  - Dr Maria Moiron (CEFE-CNRS, Montpellier): mariamoironc<at>gmail.com
#  - Dr Yimen Araya-Ajoy (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim): yimencr<at>gmail.com 


#We need to highlight that the limitation of the simulation is that two divorced individuals can not re-mate with each other.
#i.e divorced individuals con only mate with new individuals
#Also that assortative mating is caused by females "choosing a male", but also males "choosing" a female.

#Finally, there are several ways of running these analyses. This is just
# one of those, and it is not necessarily the fastest or most elegant.
