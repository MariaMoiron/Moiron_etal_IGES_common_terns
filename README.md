This repository contains the R-code used for a project on Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs) and assortative mating using data from a wild common tern population. Specifically, the repository contains the R-code used in the following study:

Moiron M,  Araya-Ajoy YG, Teplitsky C, Bouwhuis S†, Charmantier A† (2020) Understanding the social dynamics of breeding phenology: indirect genetic effects and assortative mating in a long distance migrant. The American Naturalist  196(5):566-76 (doi: 10.1086/711045)
†  = shared authorship

The code provided here is sufficient to replicate the simulations presented in the above paper. 

If you are interested in running the same or additional simulations, and need help feel free to get in touch with at least one (preferably both) of the following researchers:
